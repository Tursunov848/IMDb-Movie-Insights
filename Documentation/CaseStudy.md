üéì IMDb Movie Insights Project ‚Äì Professional Case Study
üéØ Objective
To design a robust data pipeline that scrapes, enriches, and analyzes IMDb‚Äôs Top 250 Movies, culminating in an interactive Power BI dashboard for uncovering actionable insights about movie performance.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas)

OMDb API

Power BI Desktop

Git / GitHub for version control

üß© Process Overview
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
Initial Web Scraping

Extracted movie titles, descriptions, and URLs from IMDb‚Äôs Top 250 page.

Addressed challenges:

Dynamic content requiring precise HTML selectors.

Special character encoding issues.

Detailed Scraping

For each movie URL, parsed additional metadata: runtime, genre, director, top cast, and gross worldwide revenue.

Where scraping did not yield reliable results (e.g., missing runtime), used OMDb API for consistent enrichment.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preparation
Normalized numeric fields (box office, ratings, votes).

Split multi-genre strings into separate records (many-to-many relationships).

Created derived fields:

BoxOffice_Million

BoxOffice_Label (for formatting)

Verified data integrity and handled missing values.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling in Power BI
Imported cleaned datasets.

Established relationships:

One-to-many between Movies and Genres.

Calendar table linked to Release Year.

Additional Budget table joined by IMDb ID.

Defined calculated columns and measures using DAX.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Design

üí° Key Learnings
Combining scraping with API enrichment dramatically improves data quality.

Thoughtful data modeling prevents duplication issues in Power BI.

Simplicity and clarity in visuals yield more actionable insights than overcrowding dashboards.
